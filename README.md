# Edge-AI Smart Agriculture System

This repository contains a **re-implemented research prototype** demonstrating
an edge-AI sensing and decision pipeline for sustainable agriculture.

## Overview
- Environmental sensing using ESP32 + DHT22
- Image-based crop health inference (placeholder model)
- Edge-oriented system design for low-latency operation

## Note
The original system was developed during a hackathon deployment.
This version is re-implemented for research demonstration purposes.

## Tools
- ESP32
- Embedded C++
- Python
- OpenCV (conceptual)
